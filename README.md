# Supersnake
> Supersnake discovered its destructive power of shooting snot fire balls and puts this to good use.

## Description
I'm really excited to participate in OLC CodeJam 2019. It was my first time using the oldPixelGameEngine and the code needs a lot of work but I'm pleased with what I accomplished in a few days. The game is no where near finished and I hope to continue working on it. 

Snake has lived a full long life eating fruit, getting longer and just living it up in homes and arcades all across the world. One day, snake felt warmth emanating from it's nostrils , the tingling caused a violent sneeze which shot a fireball across the room. Upon discovering this destructive power it ventured once more into the world to eat fruit and this time burn some walls too.
